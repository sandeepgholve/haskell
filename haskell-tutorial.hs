-- Integer is un-bounded whole number
-- "Integer" is an arbitrary precision type: it will hold any number no matter 
-- how big, up to the limit of your machine's memoryâ€¦. This means you never 
-- have arithmetic overflows. On the other hand it also means your arithmetic is
-- relatively slow. Lisp users may recognise the "bignum" type here.
--
-- "Int" is the more common 32 or 64 bit integer. Implementations vary, 
-- although it is guaranteed to be at least 30 bits.


-- Float - precision point is upto 11

-- Adding negative number requires additional parentheses as follows:

-- Square Root function works on floating number so we need coversion as
-- follows:
